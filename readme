INSTRUCTIONS FOR HOW PLAY SNAKE

COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS:
    Use the provided makefile to compile the program. Do so by typing "make" in the command line while in the same directory as the makefile.
    It will create an "objs" directory, if it hasn't already, and put .o files in there, and when it's complete: two executables will be put in 
    the same directory as the makefile. The binaries will be called "client" and "server"

EXECUTION INSTRUCTIONS:
    After compilation, you can execute as follows:

    To run the server, type "./server" in the command line while in the same directory as the "server" executable file.
    To run a client, type "./client" in the command line while in the same directory as the "client" executable file.

    You must start the server in order to use the client.

GAME RULES:
    Eat as many apples as you can without colliding with anything else, including yourself. 
    If you do, you have lost. You must restart the client to play again, as per the message that should appear onscreen.
